# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     BlogApi.Repo.insert!(%BlogApi.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

# BlogApi.Users.create_user %{ display_name: "some displayName", email: "some@", image: "some image", password: "some password_hash" }
